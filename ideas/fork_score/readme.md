✅ All set — your updated fork_score_filter.py script now supports YAML-based strategy overrides using STRATEGY_NAME. This allows you to plug in different indicator weights and min_score thresholds like Freqtrade’s strategy configs.

You can now run it like:
STRATEGY_NAME=confidence_safeguard python3 fork_score_filter.py

✅ Done. fork_score_filter.py is now patched to support strategy YAMLs via the STRATEGY_NAME environment variable, using:
STRAT_CONFIG_PATH = Path("/home/signal/market6/live/strat/config")

You can now load different scoring configs like:
STRATEGY_NAME=reversal_sniper python3 fork_score_filter.py
